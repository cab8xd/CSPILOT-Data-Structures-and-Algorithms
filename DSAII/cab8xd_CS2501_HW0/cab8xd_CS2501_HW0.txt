It is a far finer gambit than any chess play: a chess player may offer the sacrifice of a pawn or even a piece, but a mathematician offers the game. [Excerpt from {\em A Mathematician's Apology}, G.H. Hardy, 1940, p. 94]  \end{quote}\noindent Learn how to write math and construct proofs by reproducing the proof below. You will need to use the \verb|eqnarray| environment, as well as the \verb|eqnarray*| environment.\begin{definition}A rational number is a fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers. \end{definition}\noindent Show $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.\begin{proof}\parFor a rational number $\frac{a}{b}$,without loss of generality we may suppose that \emph{a} and \emph{b} are integers which share no common factors, as otherwise we could remove any common factors (i.e. suppose $\frac{a}{b}$ is in simplest terms). To say $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational is equivalent to stating that 2 cannot be expressed in the form $(\frac{a}{b})^2$. Equivalently, this says that there are no integer values for a and b satisfying \begin{equation}a = 2b^2\end{equation}\parWe argue by \textit{reductio ad absurdum}  (proof by contradiction). Assume toward reaching a contradiction that Equation \textcolor{red}{1} holds for $a$ and $b$ being integers without common factor between them. It must be that $a^2$ is even, since $2b^2$ is divisible by $2$, therefore $a$ is even. If $a$ is even, then for some integer $c$$$a = 2c$$$$a^2 = (2c)^2$$$$2b^2 = 4c^2$$$$b^2 = 2c^2$$therefore, $b$ is even. This implies that $a$ and $b$ are both even, and thus share a common factor of $2$. This contradicts our hypothesis, therefore our hypothesis is false. \end{proof}\begin{problem} Images \end{problem}Learn how to include drawings in your documents with the \verb|\includegraphics{file}| command.
