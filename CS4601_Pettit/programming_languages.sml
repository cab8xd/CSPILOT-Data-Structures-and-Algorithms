For each exercise below, create an ML function that will perform the specified task. The function definitions have been given to you.
 Run each function agaist your own test cases to verify correctness. Include the test cases that you ran and the results in the comments for each exercsie.
 You may create helper functions (additional functions that are called from the main function), which may be particularly useful with the last 4 exercises.   

Please submit one file named HW02_<user_id>.ml (i.e. HW02_rp6zr.ml). 
Please make a copy of this assignment file to use as your starting point. 
I have used the label "TODO" to indicate locations in the file that you need to attend to. 
Do not change the function names. 
Please uncomment out all of your functions before submitting.
 As part of the grading process, 
 we will be adding function calls to the end of your submitted file and running it. 

This homework assignment is intended to give you practice with ML to the 
extent that we have covered in class through 9/17/19. 
Please resist using more advanced ML features that have not been covered yet. 
The intent of these exercises is to get practice with tuples, lists, and functions, 
and to use the ML that we have been introduced to so far. 
ML keywords/operators/functions that we have used as of 9/17/19:

(* *), ;, int, real, bool, true, false, string, char, #, ~,+, -, *, /, div, mod, <, >, <=, >=, =, <>, ^, andalso, orelse, not, if, then, else, floor, ceil, round, trunc, ord, ", val, ->,  list, (), [], nil,  null, @, ::, hd, tl, explode, implode, fun, fn, :	

If you think that you need to use functionality that is not listed above, please post a question to Piazza.

(*
************** Exercise 10 **************

fun isPrime n = if n = 2 then true else not(isDiv(n, 2));
fun isDiv (n, i) = if i <= (n - 1) then n mod i = 0 orelse isDiv(n, i + 1) else true;


(*
************** Exercise 15 **************
Goal: Conditionally select items from a list that pass a given test.

Details: Your function, select, should receive a list (i.e. [4,5,6,7,8,9])

and a Boolean function (i.e. your prime function from the exercise above). 
The items in the list should be legal to send in to the Boolean function. 
The select function should produce a list that is a subset of the initial
list. The type of your function will be: 
fn : 'a list * ('a -> bool) -> 'a list 
An example declaration: 
Calling the function this way: select([4,5,6,7,8,9],isPrime);
Should produce: val it = [5,7] : int list
Cases that I tested:

select([1,13,3,4,5,101],isPrime);
select([4,5,6,7,8,9],isPrime);
val it = [5,7] : int list
val it = [1,13,3,5,101] : int list

Comments added by student:
*)

fun select(n, f) =	if n = [] then [] else if f (hd n) then [hd n] @ select(tl n, f) else select(tl n, f);
